# Hello! I'm Traz
My full name is Alex Trazkovich. My last name is pretty much phonetic: Traz-ko-vich rhymes with Jazz-Bro-Snitch.

You can call me Alex or Traz--I respond to either, but historically most people at most places I've worked have called me Traz. My personal pronouns are he/him/his. 

If you just joined my team or if I just joined yours, this README document will serve as a guide to understanding me and how I try to lead. If you've already been working with me for a while, then you've probably figured out a lot of this already, but hoipefully this docuent will fill in some gaps.

If anything in this document is unclear, please let me know. It is, like life, a work in progress.

# Motivation for this document
Leadership READMEs seem weird at first but they make perfect sense. In tech, most of us value communication, transparency and good documentation. Ledadership is about human beings, relationshionships and, of course, values. If I value communication, transparency and good documentation, wouldn't it make sense that this is where we start? So, let's begin...

# My role
You may report to me, but I am not your superior. We are teammates, I am a team member with a particular role, and a lot of my job is to serve you. I'm not as successful as I can be if you are not as successful as you can be. I want that for you. I want you to have success in your work life, your home life, and your career. To do that, I need to create the best environment that I can to ensure your success. This means that ideally I fill the following roles:

* As an ambassador for our team and the engineering team in general. I always need to ensure that our efforts are aligned with other teams and that we are all serving our mutual goals effectively.
* As a mentor. I don't profess to have all the answers, but I do have the benefit of having made plenty of mistakes, and it's likely that you can benefit from some of those.
* As an unblocker of your work. I think this goes without saying, but I need to remove obstacles that get in your way.
* As someone who holds us all accountable. This is really about focus and making sure that the wheels stay on the cart.
* As an example. I will strive to be open, conscientious and focused. I will also fail at this from time to time but I will persevere in this.
* As an advocate for good decisions. I believe all opinions should be heard and respected but I also know most of even the best decisions are compromises. I like decisions that are driven by data and known best practices but I also see the value in ideas that are truly disruptive.
* As an advocate for **you**. I want to help you grow, succeed, and find opportunities to excel.

# What I value most
Empathy.  There are a lot of related terms that also matter--kindness, compassion, respect, to name a few--but empathy is at the heart of it all. Always consider how other people feel or will feel, both as a result of your own actions and in general.

# What you can expect from me
I believe that the old maxim that “respect is earned, not given” is toxic. Respect can be earned back if it is lost, but the default human condition should be to respect others regardless of ethnicity, national origin, religion or lack thereof, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical characteristics or anything else that is used to separate us -- just by virtue of being human. You can and should expect that I will show respect for you -- that I will do everything I can to ensure that you are in a respectful and safe environment. That respect manifests in the following ways:

* **I will listen to your ideas.**
* **I will work to ensure you have the tools to do your job.**
* **I will not micromanage you.**
* **I will be honest with you.**
* **I will always endeavor to help you succeed.**

# Personal quirks
My technical knowledge is very broad (or, at a minimum, ecclectic--how many people have degrees in both Robotics and Chemical engineering?), but in most areas it is not very deep. There's a good chance that includes your area! In fact, most people who have ever reported to me know more about their area of expertise than I do--and most of those know a LOT more. So far this has worked out fine, given the role that I outline above. I am also an active, curious learner, and I'll probably ask you lots of questions, some of which will be poorly posed or so basic that they will reveal just how little I know about your field.  But that's okay! I ask these questions because I'm excited to learn.  On the plus side, I bring very little technical bias to the conversation, and am happy to hear out all ideas and then advocate for the best one.

Related to the above: I have really bad imposter syndrome. I know this and I’m working on it. One of the ways I channel this is into frequent (some would say excession) self-deprecating humor. If this bothers you, let me know.

In general, I am high energy and use a lot of humor in the workplace. I try to keep this humor respectful and kind, but if I ever make a joke that bothers you, please let me know. Similarly, if my energy level ever annoys you or distracts you in a bad way, let me know, and I'll try to tone it down.

Speaking of which: I love feedback, especially when it's critical. I may look sad when you deliver it, but I will always apreciate it, and I will always try to thank you for it.

# What I expect from you
I would rather work with a empathetic average engineer than an unkind technical "superstar". What's more, in my experience, 9 times out of 10 a team composed of the former will actually outperform the latter.
Of course, **true** superstars are both great technically **and** are empathetic, and teams composed of people like this produce the best results, by far. So practice empathy actively, and take actions that will leader to better long term outcomes for the human beings around you.

What does empathy look like in the wild?

* **Never throw a teammate under the bus.** They need to trust you and you need to trust them. If you have a disagreement, discreetly talk to them. If that doesn’t work, both of you should discreetly talk to me together.
* **You represent your team to the rest of the world.** Don’t make us look bad. Foster respect and good will among other teams and users.
* **Help your teammates succeed.** Collaborate, teach, mentor, provide active feedback, and generally help everyone be better at their jobs.
* **Be on time.** Don’t mismanage your time at the expense of others. Personally, I have a tendency to run late and show up late to meetings; call me out on this, because it's not cool.
* **Be transparent.** If you are struggling with something, let me know. This includes personal issues--I need to be aware of how this might impact your work so I can plan around it. Also note that while I am always happy to listen as a friend, I don't need details if you aren't comfortable sharing them--it's perfectly okay to say "I'm struggling with a personal issue, I'll be out next week and then my focus wil be divided for a week or two after that, but after that point things should settle down." However, if you start disapearing or becoming intensely distracted without communicating that something is going on, that raises a lot of red flags for me.
* **Challenge me.** If I’m on the wrong path, as I often will be, I need to know it.
* **Treat the production environment as a holy thing.** Our users need to trust the systems we create. Don’t ship broken code in order to meet a deadline. If you find a bug in production, take ownership of it by fixing it and/or filing a ticket. At the same time, the production environment is not so sacrosanct that we shouldn't takes any risks--it's just that those risks should be mitigated as much as possible via design docs, peer review, and appropriate testing. Speaking of which: 
* **Take chances and try new things.** In tech, complacency is death.
* **Speak up and speak truth to power.** Your opinions matter. Be honest, even when the news is not what someone wants to here. Be especially conscious of providing reasonable time estimates for projects that take into account uncertainty and the potential for unexpected delays. Don't just give the most optimistic estimate becuase you believe it's what leadership wants to here.
* **Maintain a healthy work/life balance.** The idea that you have to work 60+ hour weeks in tech is misguided. Working more hours just becomes a justification to be less efficient. I would much prefer you are sharp and focussed 35 hours a week than a zombie that works 70 hours a week. Also, make sure to use PTO.

# What can make me not like you
* **Having an "ego".** By all means, be confident in your abilities and be proud of your good work, but don't be arrogant, and never, EVER denegrate others to make yourself feel better. 
* **Duplicity, deception, or lying.** Don't lie to me, your team, our customers, or yourself.
* **Damaging the team or your teammates.** We must be able to trust each other.
* **Willfully or neglectfully damaging the product.** We're relying on you to make the product better -- not worse. We all make honest mistakes, and that's OK, but own up to them, take responsibility, and take corrective action. 

# After hours communication
I try to set boundaries and not work weekends or after-hours unless I’m up against a challenging deadline or have some emergency. I don’t expect you to work after hours or on weekends either, barring exigent circumstances, which we will work together to make as rare as possible.  

I also don't always succeed in setting my own boundaries.  So you will sometimes see me working after hours.  This doesn't mean I expect you to also.

So in general: if you send me any email or Slack message over the weekend or after 5 pm, I may not see it. If I send you one I don’t expect you to read it--I'll call if there is an emergency. Similarly, by all means, call me in an emergency. Texts also work pretty well (actually sometimes better, as my phone may be on silent). Knowing that someone will call/text if it is truly urgent is how we can all relax a little better after hours.

# Random other musings
## Leadership vs Management 
Some people (especially in spammy LinkedIn posts), distinguish between "Leadership" as a positive ideal and "Management" as a some kind of negative pitfall. This frameworks usually presents a dichotomy wherein someone in a management role can be either be a Leader or "just" a Manager. I think what are really being discussed in this framework are good managers vs bad managers (or micromanagers), which is a perfectly reasonable thing to think about, but doesn't represent how I personally frame the terms Leader and Manager.

In my book, any member of any team can be a Leader, whereas a Manager is a team member with a particular role focused on coordination and employee growth. Ideally, Managers are also Leaders, but, also ideally, they are not the only leaders on the team.
